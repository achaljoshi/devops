Feature: Launch curl attack

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name      | value                |
    | hostname  | TOKEN_ALB_HOSTNAME   |

Scenario: Verify an HTTP 200 OK is received from a curl
    When I launch a "curl" attack with:
        """
        curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out "%{http_code}" <hostname>
        """
    # check for 200 response code
    Then the output should contain:
        """
        200
        """
